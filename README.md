# Emojiâ€“Hill Cipher Teaching Activity

This repository provides reproducible materials for the paper:  
*"Emoji-Based Cryptography: A Pedagogical Framework for Teaching Linear Algebra in Data Science Education"* (submitted to *Scatterplot: The MAA Journal of Data Science *).

## Overview
The notebook `examples.ipynb` implements an extended Hill cipher using a hybrid alphabet of letters, digits, and emojis.  
It reproduces the encryption and decryption examples presented in the paper, illustrating core linear algebra concepts:
- Matrix multiplication as a linear transformation
- Determinants and invertibility over modular rings
- Encoding/decoding representations
- Applications to data science pedagogy

## Dependencies
Create a Python environment and install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
