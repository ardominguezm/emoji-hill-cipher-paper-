# Emojiâ€“Hill Cipher Teaching Activity

This repository provides reproducible materials for the paper:  
*"Emoji Encryption: Teaching Linear Algebra Concepts for Data Science through Modern Cryptography Applications"* (submitted to *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education*).

## Overview
The notebook `examples.ipynb` implements an extended Hill cipher using a hybrid alphabet of letters, digits, and emojis.  
It reproduces the encryption and decryption examples presented in the paper, illustrating core linear algebra concepts:
- Matrix multiplication as a linear transformation
- Determinants and invertibility over modular rings
- Encoding/decoding representations
- Applications to data science pedagogy

## Dependencies
Create a Python environment and install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
